## Contributing Guidelines

Hey, really thank you for contributing to StorageKit! ✌🏽

We are really keen to receive any sort of contribution, not only code. We definitely are seeking for:

- **Code**: take a look at the [open issues](issues). Any code change must be submitted as `PR`, look at [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE).
- **Community**: write blog posts, howto's, share on you social network 😀 Involving the community, StorageKit can grow up faster and improve as much as possible!
- **Design**: we'd love to re-think the StorageKit Logo!
- **QA**: if you found any bug or if you have any question, open an issue with as much details you can provide us. Look at [issue_template](issue template).
