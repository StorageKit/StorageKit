        Use this method to pass entities through different queues. `StorageEntityType` is not thread safe, this means that, if you create/fetch some entities in a queue, then you cannot you those entities in another queue.
        To pass the entities in another queue you must use this method, which create an array of new entities queue-safe for the destination context queue.
     
        Example:
     
        ```
        context.getThreadSafeEntities(for: mainContext, originalContext: bgContext, originalEntities: entities) { (safeEntities: [MyEntities]) in
        }
        ```
     
        **Note**
     
        Since the completion closure parameter is a generic array of entities, you must explicitly add the type of array elements. As you can see in the example above we specified: `safeEntities: [MyEntities]`
     
        - Parameter destinationContext: The context where you would want to use the entities.
        - Parameter originalContext: The context where the original entities come from.
        - Parameter originalEntities: The original entities which you would want to use in the destinationContext's queue.
        - Parameter completion: This closure is called once the new queue-safe entities are made. You can find the new entities in the closure parameter.

        - Throws: StorageKitErrors.Context.wrongType
